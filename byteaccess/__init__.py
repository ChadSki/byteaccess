Common interface for reading and writing binary data to files and processes.

Within a ByteAccess, offsets are relative. This means that ByteAccesses which
wrap the same data always appear and behave identically, regardless of where
that data actually is. This is useful when operations need to be performed on
identical data from different locations.

Example usage:

    import byteaccess

    if location == 'file':
        data_context = byteaccess.FileContext('filename.txt')
    elif location == 'mem'
        data_context = byteaccess.MemContext('processname')

    foo = data_context.ByteAccess(offset, size)

    foo.write_bytes(0, b'somedata')    # write data to offsets within the ByteAccess

    foo.read_bytes(2, 6)  #=> b'medata'  # read any length of data from any offset
